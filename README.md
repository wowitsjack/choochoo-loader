# ChooChoo

ChooChoo is a Proton/WINE gaming focused trainer and DLL loader featuring a dynamic UI and extensive functionality. Designed for seamless operation under both Windows and Proton/Wine environments, it provides users with an intuitive way to manage and launch games, trainers, and additional executables or DLLs.

It is designed for launching trainers (FLiNG etc), patchers, and ensuring that they can all be recognised and see each other in the Proton/WINE context, and perform the memory access required to load cheats, or do DLL injection.
