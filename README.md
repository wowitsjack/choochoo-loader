### **Why is this Needed for Proton/WINE?**  

Running game trainers, patches, and DLL injectors in **Proton** or **WINE** can be problematic due to compatibility issues, anti-cheat false positives, and differences in Windows API implementations. Many game trainers and mods rely on system calls that work natively on Windows but fail under Proton/WINE.  

**ChooChoo** solves these issues by:  

‚úÖ **Ensuring Proper Trainer Execution** ‚Äì Many trainers rely on system-level hooks and memory modifications that fail in WINE. ChooChoo makes sure they load properly.  

‚úÖ **DLL Injection Support** ‚Äì Some patches, mods, or debuggers need to inject DLLs into the game process, which can fail in WINE without proper handling.  

‚úÖ **Multiple Executable Launching** ‚Äì Games requiring launchers, mod frameworks, or patches alongside the main executable can be difficult to set up in Proton.  

‚úÖ **Proton/WINE UI Compatibility Fixes** ‚Äì Prevents common graphical/UI bugs that occur when running trainers in a non-native Windows environment.  

‚úÖ **Seamless Steam Deck Integration** ‚Äì Works effortlessly with Steam‚Äôs Proton compatibility layer, making it easy to add trainers and patches on the go.  

Whether you are playing on **Linux**, **macOS (via Whisky)**, or **Steam Deck**, **ChooChoo** makes sure that your trainers, DLLs, and patches just...work.

ln -s ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common ~/STEAMGAMES
```
## WeMod/Trainer Not Launching (Fix) (Proton/WINE)  

If trainers like **WeMod** aren‚Äôt working, remove **Wine-Mono** and install .NET instead using **Protontricks** or **Heroic Launcher**.  

### Using Protontricks  

1. Install Protontricks (if not installed)  
   ```flatpak install com.github.Matoking.protontricks``` 

2. Open Protontricks & Select Your Game  
   ```protontricks --gui```  or launch it from the menu in Desktop mode.
   - Select your **game/trainer bottle**  
   - Choose **Run Wine Control Panel**  

3. Uninstall Wine-Mono  
   - In **Control Panel**, go to **Add/Remove Programs**  
   - Find **Wine Mono Windows Support**  
   - Click **Uninstall** and follow the prompts  

4. Install .NET Framework (if needed)
   - Set your Bottle's Windows Version to Windows 7 using the Wine Control Panel.
   - Download .NET from **Microsoft‚Äôs official site**  (You'll want .NET 4.7.1 if you're using WeMod)
   - Inside Protontricks, select **Run Wine File Manager** or **Run EXE** 
   - Run the .NET installer inside the Wine bottle
   - Set your Bottle's Windows Version back to Windows 10 using the Wine Control Panel.

### Using Heroic Launcher  

1. Open **Heroic Launcher**

7. Press **OK** to return to the WineTricks GUI
8. Select **Run an arbitrary executable (.exe/.msi/msu)** and use this to install .NET from the official installer.

   (You'll want .NET 4.7.1 for WeMod)

Now trainers like **WeMod** should work properly on Steam Deck.

## **Quick Start (macOS with Whisky)**

1. **Install Whisky**  
   - Get the latest version of **Whisky** for macOS.

2. **Create a Bottle & Add ChooChoo**  
   - In Whisky, create a new **bottle**.  
   - Use **"Run Executable"** and pick `ChooChoo.exe` to place it in the bottle.

3. **Configure & Run**  
   - In the bottle‚Äôs settings, enable **DXVK** (and other needed compatibility tweaks).  
   - Press **Run** to start ChooChoo.  
   - Inside ChooChoo, set **Game Path**, **Trainer Path**, and extras.  
   - **Launch** to start your game + trainer simultaneously.
  
<del>If trainers like <b>WeMod</b> are not working properly in <b>CrossOver/Whisky</b>, removing <b>Wine-Mono</b> and installing the official <b>.NET Framework</b> can help.</del>

<del>## WeMod/Trainer Not Launching (Fix) (macOS)</del>

<del>**Open Whisky**</del>  
<del>- Launch **Whisky** on macOS.</del>

<del>**Go to Bottle Configuration**</del>  
<del>- Open your game/trainer's **bottle** in Whisky and hit Bottle Configuration.</del>

<del>**Open Control Panel**</del>  
<del>- Inside the bottle, open **Control Panel**.</del>

<del>**Uninstall Wine-Mono**</del>  
<del>- In **Control Panel**, go to **Applications** or **Add/Remove Programs**.</del>  
<del>- Set your Bottle's Windows Version to Windows 7 using the Wine Control Panel.</del>  
<del>- Find **Wine Mono Windows Support**.</del>  
<del>- Click **Uninstall** and follow the prompts.</del>  

<del>### **Install .NET Framework (Manually)**</del>  

<del>Since some trainers require .NET, download and install it manually:</del>  

<del>1. **Download the .NET Framework** from [Microsoft‚Äôs official site](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework).</del>  
<del>2. Set your Bottle's Windows Version to Windows 7 using the Wine Control Panel.</del>  
<del>3. Inside Whisky, **run the .NET installer** inside the bottle.</del>  
<del>4. Follow the installation steps as you would on Windows.</del>  
<del>5. Set your Bottle's Windows Version back to Windows 10 using the Wine Control Panel.</del>  

<del>(WeMod will want .NET 4.7.1)</del>  

<del>After this, **WeMod and other trainers** should now work correctly in **WINE/Proton on macOS**</del>  

The developers of Whisky have stated they do not intend to upgrade Whisky to a functional version of WINE to allow modern Windows binaries. 
The Whisky project is not suitable for use with ChooChoo and ChooChoo style video gaming.
Unfortuntely there is nothing the end user can do about this.

üî• New & Improved Features!

üöÄ DLL Injection Overhaul

Checks 32-bit/64-bit compatibility before injecting.
Refuses mismatched DLLs (skips injection, logs an error).
Real-time UI updates: each validated DLL is marked and displayed.
Only logs each injection attempt once, preventing spam in the status box.

üïπÔ∏è Refined XInput Handling

Scoped controller input: no more unintentional global actions when certain popups or combos are focused.
Properly interprets dpad vs. thumbstick movements, ignoring slight joystick drifts.
Enhanced button mappings for easy menu navigation (e.g., A = Enter, B = Cancel, etc.).

üìú Command-Line Enhancements

-p "ProfileName": Loads a saved profile (paths, DLLs, etc.) on startup.
-autolaunch: Starts the configured game automatically after a short delay.
-dllinject [Dll1.dll] [Dll2.dll] ...: Injects specified DLLs (up to five), either absolute or relative paths.
Logs a clear message if any specified DLL doesn't exist or if the limit of five is exceeded.

üñ•Ô∏è UI & Stability Improvements

Windows Forms interface: simpler, more intuitive, drastically easier to maintain.
Controlled list refresh: the DLL list only updates on demand (or after an injection event), preserving scroll position and preventing flicker.
Robust error handling: handles missing files, incorrect bitness, or invalid profiles gracefully.

üõ†Ô∏è Fixes & Optimizations

Launch button overlapping is resolved.
DLL validation logs appear only once (preventing log spam).
Auto-launch system improved: can be toggled in settings or triggered from command line.
Profiles are automatically saved to profiles\last.ini on each launch, so your last-used config is always restored.
