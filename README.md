### **Why is this Needed for Proton/WINE?**  

Running game trainers, patches, and DLL injectors in **Proton** or **WINE** can be problematic due to compatibility issues, anti-cheat false positives, and differences in Windows API implementations. Many game trainers and mods rely on system calls that work natively on Windows but fail under Proton/WINE.  

**ChooChoo** solves these issues by:  
âœ… **Ensuring Proper Trainer Execution** â€“ Many trainers rely on system-level hooks and memory modifications that fail in WINE. ChooChoo makes sure they load properly.  
âœ… **DLL Injection Support** â€“ Some patches, mods, or debuggers need to inject DLLs into the game process, which can fail in WINE without proper handling.  
âœ… **Multiple Executable Launching** â€“ Games requiring launchers, mod frameworks, or patches alongside the main executable can be difficult to set up in Proton.  
âœ… **Proton/WINE UI Compatibility Fixes** â€“ Prevents common graphical/UI bugs that occur when running trainers in a non-native Windows environment.  
âœ… **Seamless Steam Deck Integration** â€“ Works effortlessly with Steamâ€™s Proton compatibility layer, making it easy to add trainers and patches on the go.  

Whether you are playing on **Linux**, **macOS (via Whisky)**, or **Steam Deck**, **ChooChoo** makes sure that your trainers, DLLs, and patches run just...work.
