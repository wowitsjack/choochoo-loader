### **Why is this Needed for Proton/WINE?**  

Running game trainers, patches, and DLL injectors in **Proton** or **WINE** can be problematic due to compatibility issues, anti-cheat false positives, and differences in Windows API implementations. Many game trainers and mods rely on system calls that work natively on Windows but fail under Proton/WINE.  

**ChooChoo** solves these issues by:  

‚úÖ **Ensuring Proper Trainer Execution** ‚Äì Many trainers rely on system-level hooks and memory modifications that fail in WINE. ChooChoo makes sure they load properly.  

‚úÖ **DLL Injection Support** ‚Äì Some patches, mods, or debuggers need to inject DLLs into the game process, which can fail in WINE without proper handling.  

‚úÖ **Multiple Executable Launching** ‚Äì Games requiring launchers, mod frameworks, or patches alongside the main executable can be difficult to set up in Proton.  

‚úÖ **Proton/WINE UI Compatibility Fixes** ‚Äì Prevents common graphical/UI bugs that occur when running trainers in a non-native Windows environment.  

‚úÖ **Seamless Steam Deck Integration** ‚Äì Works effortlessly with Steam‚Äôs Proton compatibility layer, making it easy to add trainers and patches on the go.  

Whether you are playing on **Linux**, **macOS (via Whisky)**, or **Steam Deck**, **ChooChoo** makes sure that your trainers, DLLs, and patches run just...work.

## **Quick Start (macOS with Whisky)**

1. **Install Whisky**  
   - Get the latest version of **Whisky** for macOS.

2. **Create a Bottle & Add ChooChoo**  
   - In Whisky, create a new **bottle**.  
   - Use **"Run Executable"** and pick `choochoo.exe` to place it in the bottle.

3. **Configure & Run**  
   - In the bottle‚Äôs settings, enable **DXVK** (and other needed compatibility tweaks).  
   - Press **Run** to start ChooChoo.  
   - Inside ChooChoo, set **Game Path**, **Trainer Path**, and extras.  
   - **Launch** to start your game + trainer simultaneously.
  
If trainers like **WeMod** are not working properly in **WINE/Whisky**, removing **Wine-Mono** and installing the official **.NET Framework** can help.  

## WeMod/Trainer Not Launching (Fix) (Proton/WINE) 

 **Open Whisky** üç∑  
   - Launch **Whisky** on macOS.  

 **Go to Bottle Configuration** ‚öôÔ∏è

   - Find **Wine Mono Windows Support**.  
   - Click **Uninstall** and follow the prompts.  

### **üîÑ Install .NET Framework (Manually)**  

Since some trainers require .NET, download and install it manually:  

1. **Download the .NET Framework** from [Microsoft‚Äôs official site](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework).  
2. Inside Whisky, **run the .NET installer** inside the bottle.  
3. Follow the installation steps as you would on Windows.  

(WeMod will want .NET 4.7.1)
